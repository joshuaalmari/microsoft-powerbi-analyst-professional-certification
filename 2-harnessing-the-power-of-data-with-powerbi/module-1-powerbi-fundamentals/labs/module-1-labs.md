### 🧪 Lab 1: How to View a Report
* **Objective:** Explore an existing Power BI report (`.pbix`) to understand how end-users interact with dashboards. The goal was to master navigation, drilling down into hierarchical data, and filtering visual elements.
* **Files:**

    * [📊 View Sample Report](./lab-1-how-to-view-a-report/Sales%20and%20Returns%20Sample.pbix)

#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Interface Navigation:** Identified and utilized key UI components including the Ribbon, Report View, Visualizations Pane, and Fields Pane.
* **Interactivity:** Used **Cross-Highlighting** by clicking on specific data bars (e.g., a specific product category) to automatically filter all other visuals on the page.
* **Drill-Down Analysis:** Used the "Drill Down" arrows to move from a high-level category view (e.g., "Bikes") to a granular view (e.g., "Road Bikes", "Mountain Bikes") without losing context.
* **Visual Management:** Practiced resizing, moving, and examining the underlying data of charts using the "Show as Table" feature.

### 🧪 Lab 2: Generate a Visualization
* **Objective:** Transform a raw sales dataset (`.csv`) into an interactive dashboard. The task required importing data, building multiple chart types to display trends, and adding interactive controls for user self-service.

#### Key Visuals Built:
* **Interactive Slicers:** Created on-canvas filters for "Product Category" and "Payment Method," enabling users to slice the entire report by specific segments instantly.
* **Stacked Column Chart:** Designed a chart to visualize **Order Total** by product size, categorized by product type, allowing for a clear comparison of revenue drivers.
* **Donut Chart:** Built a proportional visualization to show the **Order Total Share** by category, providing an immediate view of the most dominant product lines.
* **Data Table:** Added a detailed table visual to list specific **Product Names** alongside their exact **Order Totals**, offering precise data access alongside the high-level charts.
