## 📋 Practical Labs & Exercises

This module focuses on advanced data validation and performance optimization. The exercises involve using statistical profiling tools to audit data quality, implementing best practices for efficient data loading, and managing query architecture to reduce memory usage.

### 🧪 Lab 1: Profiling a Dataset
* **Objective:** Perform a statistical audit on a newly acquired product dataset (`Other Company Products.xlsx`) to validate data quality before integration. The goal was to identify distribution patterns and detect outliers.

    * [📊 View Profiled Report](./lab-1-profiling-a-dataset/Profiling%20a%20Dataset.pbix)

#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Column Quality Analysis:** Used the "Column Quality" view to instantly quantify the percentage of **Error** and **Empty** values in the `ProductKey` column.
* **Distribution Analysis:** Leveraged "Column Distribution" to identify the number of **Distinct** vs. **Unique** values, ensuring primary keys were truly unique.
* **Statistical Profiling:** Activated "Column Profile" to calculate **Min/Max/Average** statistics for the `Price` column, successfully identifying pricing outliers that required investigation.

### 🧪 Lab 2: Import a Dataset with Best Practices
* **Objective:** Import a large sales dataset while adhering to performance best practices. The task involved filtering data *during* the import process to minimize memory footprint.

    * [📊 View Optimized Model](./lab-2-import-a-dataset-best-practices/Optimized_Sales_Import.pbix)

#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Delimited Text Import:** Configured the CSV import settings to use **Tab** delimiters, ensuring the raw text parsed correctly into columns.
* **Query Folding (Filtering at Source):** Applied a **Date Filter** ("In the Previous 5 Years") immediately upon import. This reduces the volume of data loaded into the model, significantly improving refresh performance.
* **Proactive Cleaning:** Removed rows with **Errors** in the `ProductKey` column and filtered out **Null** values in the `OrderDate` column before any transformation logic was applied.

### 🧪 Lab 3: Using Reference Queries
* **Objective:** Merge data from two sources without altering the original queries. This required creating a "Reference" architecture where the original data remains untouched while a new query handles the transformation.
* **Files:**
    * [📂 View Lab Files](./lab-3-using-reference-queries/)
    * [📊 View Modular Report](./lab-3-using-reference-queries/Using%20Reference%20Queries.pbix)

#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Query Referencing:** Created new queries by right-clicking and selecting **Reference** on the base tables (`AdventureWorksSales` and `OtherSales`).
* **Transformation Isolation:** Applied column renaming and formatting *only* to the referenced queries, ensuring the source queries remained pristine for other potential uses.
* **Consolidation:** Appended the two *referenced* queries into a final "Consolidated Sales" table.

### 🧪 Lab 4: Disabling Helper Queries
* **Objective:** Optimize the data model by preventing intermediate "Helper Queries" from loading into memory. This ensures only the final, clean data is accessible to report users.
* **Files:**
    * [📂 View Lab Files](./lab-4-disabling-helper-queries/)
    * [📊 View Tuned Model](./lab-4-disabling-helper-queries/Disabling%20Helper%20Queries.pbix)

#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Identification:** Identified intermediate queries (e.g., "Transform Sample File") that were automatically generated by Power BI during a folder import.
* **Load Management:** Right-clicked specific queries and unchecked **"Enable Load"**. This keeps the query active for transformation logic but stops it from consuming RAM or appearing in the final report view.
* **Impact:** Reduced the visual clutter in the "Fields" pane and improved report refresh speed.
