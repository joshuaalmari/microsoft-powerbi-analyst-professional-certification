    * Created a detailed report page using **Bar and Column Charts** to compare current revenue against previous year figures.
    * Applied the **"Accessible City Park"** theme to ensure consistent, accessible coloring across all visuals.
    * Structured the layout logically, placing high-value KPIs at the top to guide the narrative flow.
* **Dashboard Creation (Executive Board):**
    * Published the report to the **Power BI Service**.
    * Created a new **Dashboard** by pinning only the high-level strategic visuals relevant to executives.
    * Added a **Text Box** to provide a summary of key takeaways directly on the dashboard canvas.
* **Mobile Optimization:** Configured the mobile layout for the executive dashboard to ensure the story remained clear and accessible on cellular devices.
