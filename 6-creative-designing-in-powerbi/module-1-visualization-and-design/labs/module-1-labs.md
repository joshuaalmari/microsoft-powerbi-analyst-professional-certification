* **Visual Hierarchy:**
    * Inserted the **Company Logo** in the top-left corner to establish brand identity.
    * Increased title font sizes to **20pt (Bold)** to guide the viewer's eye.
* **Color Strategy:** Applied distinct text colors to differentiate time periods, setting "Q1" titles to **Orange** and "Q2" titles to **Green** to create immediate visual distinction between the quarters.

#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Visual Consistency:** Applied the **"Accessible City Park"** report theme to instantly standardize fonts and color palettes across the Table and Column Chart visuals.
* **Conditional Formatting (Table):** Configured dynamic font coloring for the *Sales 2022* column using specific hex codes:
    * **Minimum Value:** Light Pink (`#f1c4cc`)
    * **Maximum Value:** Dark Red (`#6f3640`)
* **Data Point Emphasis (Chart):** Manually overrode the default color for the **"2022 Sales"** bar, changing it to **Gold** (`#AD8F21`) to visually isolate current performance from the targets.
